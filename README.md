In this lesson, I practiced advanced SQL queries. After creating a table of customers and orders, I used aggregate functions, such as SUM(), and then grouped rows by an identifying value such as the customer ID to display the results. If we use WHERE in a statement with GROUP BY, the query will filter prior to grouping, whereas HAVING will filter after grouping. The two most commonly used joins are INNER JOINs, which only join tables when the primary and foreign keys find a match, and LEFT JOINs, which will include all details in the left table and only include details from the right table when a match is found among the primary and foreign keys.
